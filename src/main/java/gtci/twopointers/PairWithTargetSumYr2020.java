     * The time complexity of this algorithm will be O(N âˆ— logN). Can we do better than this?
     *
     * We can follow the Two Pointers approach. We will start with one pointer pointing to the
     * beginning of the array and another pointing at the end. At every step, we will see if the
     * numbers pointed by the two pointers add up to the target sum. If they do, we have found our
     * pair; otherwise, we will do one of two things:
     *
     *   1. If the sum of the two numbers pointed by the two pointers is greater than the target
     *      sum, this means that we need a pair with a smaller sum. So, to try more pairs, we can
     *      decrement the end-pointer.
     *   2. If the sum of the two numbers pointed by the two pointers is smaller than the target
     *      sum, this means that we need a pair with a larger sum. So, to try more pairs, we can
     *      increment the start-pointer.
