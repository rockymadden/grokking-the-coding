 * that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
 *
 * You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree. You will pick one
 * fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third
 * fruit type.
 *
 * Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.
